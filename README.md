# PriceCheckCrowdSourceAPI
![Image Only](DesignDocuments/images/pricecheck.png)
  This web service is a crowd source solution for the savvy and thrifty 
  consumers who would like to but grocery items from the closest grocery for the
   cheapest price. This web service would be able to return price of grocery 
   items in the location of the consumer. If not available, it gives the ability to upload 
   prices to help other consumers. In time the database created by the users 
   would grow and be helpful for all consumers.

### Problem Statement
Grocery item prices are some of the most volatile prices out there. Consumers
 always wanted to get the cheapest there is but these prices are not publicly
  published for good reasons. The competition is stiff and undercutting a 
  competitor is easy. Grocers win customers on basis of location proximity and 
  the image, true or not, that they sell grocery items comparatively the same
   to others. We know some items are cheaper on one store than the others but 
  consumers have no way of knowing or means for comparison. One can call each
   grocery store and ask for their price but that is tedious and time consuming.
