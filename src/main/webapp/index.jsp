    <p class="text">&quot;But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete  account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great  explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one  rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally  encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there  anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,  because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in  which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a  trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical  exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any  right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has  no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no  resultant pleasure?&quot;<br />
