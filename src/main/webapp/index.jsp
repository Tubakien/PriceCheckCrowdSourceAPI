    <p class="text">This web service is a crowd source solution for the savvy and thrifty
      consumers who would like to buy grocery items from the closest grocery for the

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />


    <p class="text">&quot;Grocery item prices are some of the most volatile prices out there. Consumers
      always wanted to get the cheapest there is but these prices are not publicly
      published for good reasons.  <br />
      The competition is stiff and undercutting a
      competitor is easy. Grocers win customers on basis of location proximity and
      the image, true or not, that they sell grocery items comparatively the same
      to others. We know some items are cheaper on one store than the others but
      consumers have no way of knowing or means for comparison. One can call each
      grocery store and ask for their price but that is tedious and time consuming. </div>

  <p class="text">&quot;But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing  pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete  account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great  explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one  rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally  encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there  anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,  because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in  which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a  trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical  exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any  right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has  no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no  resultant pleasure?&quot;<br />
